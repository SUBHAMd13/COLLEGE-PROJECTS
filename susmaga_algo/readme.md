# Importance of Susmaga Algorithm

- The problem of decomposition in Reduct Generation one of the key issues in Rough Set Theory.
- To speed up computations may be achieves by decomposing the original task into subtasks and executing these as parallel processes.
- `Reduct` means Reduction of Attributes in Information Table which related to a problem of Features Selection in Categorical Dataset.
- But generating reducts is a computationally complex task. The problem of generating a minimal reduct has been proved to be **NP-Hard**
- So the line of research directs towards different methods like:
  1. *Exact method*
  2. *Heuristic method*
  
  This algorithm follows *Exact method*.
