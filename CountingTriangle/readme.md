# Importance of finding, counting, listing triangles in a large graph
- Identifying and counting triangles helps us to measure three important metrics about large graphs.
  1. Global Clustering Coefficient
  2. Local Clustering Coefficient
  3. Transitivity Ratio T(G)
- It helps us to find patterns in social graphs, which is useful for intrusion detection, for identifying communities and spamming.
- Triangle detection in biological networks help us to find protein-protein interaction networks.
- Triangles and clustering coefficients play important roles in the analysis of complex networks using graph data structure. The existance of triangles and resulting high clustering coefficient reveals important characteristics of Social, Biological, Web and other networks.

## Installation and Procedures
- Install jdk into the system.
- Install spark into system using SBT.
- Start SBT in the terminal and run the code using `runMain CountingTriangle`.
