# DATA VISUALIZATION & EDA ON IRIS DATASET
Here using some too small data I try to extract 
some pattern which can differentiate those Iris flower species.
In this project I use some plotting tools which help to take some decisions.
A rigorous exploratory data analysis wil help to determine 
which type of learning method can be used which will train
machine to determine flowers automatically with a higher accuracy.
