# DATA VISUALIZATION & EDA
Here using some too small data I try extract some pattern which can differtiate those Iris flower species.
In this project I use some plotting tools which help to take any decision.
A rigorous exploratory data analysis wil help to determine which type of learning method can be used which will trained 
machine to determine flowers automatically with a higher accuracy.
